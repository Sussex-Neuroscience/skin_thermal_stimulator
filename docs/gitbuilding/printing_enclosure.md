The enclosure for the electronics in this project is 3D printed. The steps needed to replicate this are below:

- Download the STL files located in XXXX
- Load the files in your slicer of choice (in the lab we are using a Bambu printer, therefore we use BambuSlicer
- Print the design. We use PLA, with a layer height of 0.2mm and a density of 15%.

When you are done, your enclosure should look like this:
