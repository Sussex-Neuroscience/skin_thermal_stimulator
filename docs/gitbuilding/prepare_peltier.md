# Prepare peltier module

Heat delivery in this systems is done via the combination of a peltier element and a high precision thermistor. They need to be assembled in a specific way, so that the thermistor senses the heat and sends information to the microcontroller, which then controls the amount of power is sent to the peltier and in which direction, so that it heats/or cools down.

To complete this part of the build you will need the following parts and tools:
   * [Peltier element]{Qty:1}
