In order to use the system we require a working computer (Windows, Mac or Linux), and for the setup, access to the Internet.\n<br>\nThe steps for setting up for the first time are:\n\n\nDownload and install the Arduino Integrated Development Environment (Arduino IDE) - Follow this tutorial\n\n\nAdd, to the Arduino IDE, the board definitions for the ESP32 microcontroller - Follow this tutorial\n\nthe board definitions we are looking for are \"ESP32 by espressif (see screenshot below)\"\n\n\n\n\n\nRun the Arduino IDE for the first time and make sure it is configured properly - Follow this tutorial\n\n\nCaution \nSome window users might need to install drivers for their computers to recognised the ESP32 board properly. Please follow this tutorial\nCaution message\n\nrunning the skin thermal stimulator code on the board:\n\n\nOnce you have the microcontroller properly connected to the computer, we can download the custom code written for this project. If there are updates to the code, or users want to design their own routines, they will need to perform this step again.\n\n\nDownload the custom code from its publicly available repository\n\n\nClick on the Green \"code\" button, and then on \"download zip\" (see screenshot below). This will download a single zip file containing everything available in the repository, including our code. <br>\n\n\n\nUnzip the file, and navigate to the code folder. In it, navigate to the \"main_arduino\" folder and double click the file named \"main_arduino.ino\" (in some computers the termination \".ino\" might be omitted).\n\n\n\n\nkjsdj", "breadcrumbs": ["docs/index.md", "docs/prepare_microcontroller.md"]}]
